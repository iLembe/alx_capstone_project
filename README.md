**The Flask App**
>Web Application: This code sets up a Flask web application that can be accessed through a web browser.

>HTML Rendering: It renders an HTML page as the homepage when you access the root URL ("/"). This HTML page is usually the user interface for submitting a form.

>Form Submission: When a user submits a form on the homepage, the form data (name, email, and message) is captured.

>Database Storage: The captured form data is stored in a SQLite database, allowing the application to persist and manage user submissions.

>Debug Mode: The application is set to run in debug mode, which means it will provide detailed error messages and automatically reload when changes are made during development. This mode is beneficial for debugging and development.
